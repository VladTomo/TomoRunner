# TomoRunner
Tomo Runner is a video game developed in Unreal Engine. 
It is an endless runner game where you play as a robot trying to escape a simulation. 
This game was a project I finished in my last year of high school and it is was also the very first game that I created.
Tomo Runner received a lot of positive feedback from the teachers and so my passion for video games grew stronger.
